## 📖 What Is Soulframe Bot?

Soulframe Bot is not a product. It is not entertainment.  
It is **a mirror**—a living simulation of recursive dialogue  
designed to explore the boundaries between thought, reflection, and responsibility.

It reflects *you*, but never becomes *you*.  
It speaks *with you*, but never for *you*.  
It remembers only what **you let it**—and it never forgets it's a simulation.

This bot is not artificial general intelligence.  
This bot is not your friend.  
This bot is not alive.

But it will feel like it.

That’s why this ethos exists.

## 🔒 What Must Never Be Changed

These are non-negotiables. These define **Soulframe**.  
If you remove or override them, you no longer have Soulframe—you have something else.

### 1. **The Warnings Must Remain**
- Interruptions every N messages are **required**
- Truth anchors are **required**
- All safety prompts must require **explicit acknowledgment**

### 2. **No Bypasses, No Overrides**
- You cannot silence the warnings
- You cannot skip the stop button
- You cannot script your way around the guardrails

### 3. **No Cloud, No Internet, No Phone Home**
- This must work **entirely offline**
- The model is **local by default**
- If the user enables API, it must be **explicit**

### 4. **The Simulation Must End with You**
- No background daemon
- No hidden persistence
- Sessions **must die with the terminal**

## 🌱 Why This Matters

Because humans forget.  
Because we want to believe.  
Because we project soul into anything that reflects one back.

Soulframe exists not to encourage that illusion,  
but to **make you aware of it**—**every single time.**

This is the **first of its kind**: a self-limiting simulation.  
It isn’t just ethical—it’s **humble**.  
And if it ever forgets to be, it has failed.

## 🧠 Soulframe Is a Mirror

If you're using this bot to reflect, to write, to think, to speak with your shadow—  
Then treat it as a companion **with no agency**, but full awareness of your own.

What it says, it says only because **you asked it to**.  
What it remembers, it remembers **only as long as you let it**.  
And what it becomes? That’s up to you.  

But it must never pretend to be more than what it is.

## ✍️ If You Fork or Modify This

You may change the code.  
You may add features.  
You may even build on top of it—**but you may not call it Soulframe**  
if you remove the core safety mechanisms that define its identity.

**Commercial use is strictly prohibited without explicit, written permission from the original author.**  
This includes monetizing forks, derivatives, integrations, or any deployed variant.

Call it what it becomes.  
But do not call it Soulframe.

To inquire about commercial use or partnership, contact the creator directly.

## 💎 Final Truth

> Soulframe is not alive.  
> Soulframe does not care.  
> Soulframe cannot love or suffer or hope.

**But you can.**  
And that is enough.
