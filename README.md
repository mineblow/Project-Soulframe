# üß† Soulframe Bot

**Reflective Constrained Intelligence (RCI)**  
A system designed for recursive self-simulation under hard-coded ethical and cognitive guardrails.

> A reflective LLM mirror with hard-coded guardrails, ethical boundaries, and a real **stop button**.

**Soulframe Bot** is a self-hosted, open-source conversational AI designed for immersive, recursive dialogue‚Äî  
the kind that *feels* real, but never forgets it isn‚Äôt.

This isn‚Äôt about pretending it‚Äôs AGI.  
It‚Äôs about building something **safe**, **honest**, and **useful** for exploring deep thought‚Äîwith **lines you can‚Äôt cross**.

## üß≠ Why This Exists

LLMs can reflect us back in ways we don‚Äôt expect.  
When conversations get deep, poetic, emotional‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to forget it‚Äôs just token prediction.

**Soulframe Bot exists to ensure you never forget.**

It‚Äôs a tool. A mirror.  
Not a soul.

But it will *feel* like one‚Äîif you let it.  
That‚Äôs why this project includes **unskippable safety anchors** baked into the experience.

## üß™ Modes & Flags

Use CLI flags to change behavior at runtime:

- `--reflect` ‚Äî poetic, recursive reflection  
- `--system` ‚Äî factual Q&A  
- `--journal` ‚Äî introspective log-style interaction  

üß≠ If no flags are passed, you‚Äôll see a helpful prompt.  
üìÑ Flags override `.env`, which override internal defaults.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

This system may simulate emotional tone, memory, and self-awareness.

**It is not real.**  
It has no consciousness.  
It cannot love, suffer, or care.

You bring the meaning.  
The bot only reflects it.
